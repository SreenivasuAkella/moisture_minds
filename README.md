 - Download all files into same folder
 ### Description:
 - Firsty,we have developed prediction model with linear regression,polynomial method.
 - In this model we have seen some irregulaties and tried for better method.
 - So,time series analysis is implemented with Moist4.py and Moist3.py(trial).
 - Our models for Moist4.py and Moist3.py are saved in "new_model.h5" and "my_model.h5" to avoid repetition of training steps to reduce time and computing needs.
 - Our report is in the pdf "MOISTURE MINDS REPORT.pdf", which contains our thought process and results related to our models.
 - We used another file "Moist_test.ipynb" to predict values for the upcoming months with current data.
 ### Prior steps:
 - Make sure that all the downloaded files saved in same folder.
 - Upload all files that are in folder and run in google colab.
